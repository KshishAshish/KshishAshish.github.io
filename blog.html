<p>“The” LNM Institute of Information Technology, Jaipur (Deemed University) was (Deemed “to be” University) when I came here. This detail may not make much sense to you but any LNMIITian pre-2018 can attest it's importance in our college's introduction. In the past three years, this place has given me a lifetime of memories. Most people carry regrets of better college offers on their shoulders for a better part of their life. I don’t.</p>
<p>There is something about this place that makes it mine. In the summer before I left for college, I visited every campus I had applied to and each one of the other ones was larger, more lavish, and carried “brand” names. Along with each of those brands came whiffs of commercialization. They took in little over 10,000 students every year, sent them through a joke of a system riding on the shoulders of mass-recruiters that came at the end of 4 years.</p>
<p>The day I came to Jaipur, I fell in love, first with the city and then with my college. The sheer simplicity of the campus drew me in. The red bricks of campus felt personal and for some goddamn reason, I just didn’t want to leave. The transition from home to here somehow was the most natural thing for me even though I had never lived away from home. New city, new people, and the fresh start I wished for all my life lay right in front of me.</p>
<p>The people here are not perfect but they are extraordinary. They stick to their cliques like every other college and deal with their own share of love, sex and/or dhoka. But trust me when I say this, there’s a place of everyone. Everybody wears their heart on the sleeves. The clubs, fests and campus politics are not every one's cup of tea but if your wing-mate/ club member is fighting the elections, the patriotism is enough to put current political scenario of India to shame.</p>
<p>The existence of dancers, fashionistas, etc is acknowledged annually, during cultural festival. They rise to fame for a few well-deserved nights, make us proud, (debatable) and that's about it. But their memories go way beyond just practices.</p>
<p>Somehow this college turns every soul into a photographer, writer, or poet. The place is full of strong support systems, no matter what you want to do. Say, for example, you may be terrible at writing but if you decide to give it a shot and start a blog, I can guarantee you, the “like, share, comment” web will not disappoint you.</p>
<p>People will flood you with constant appreciation, constructive criticism, and resources. Life of an engineering student is absolutely irrelevant to their career path is Lesson 101 at my “Mittal College”.</p>
